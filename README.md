# Ember.js Authentication Example

This is the example from our [blog post on Ember.js authentication](http://brewhouse.io/blog/2015/02/12/ember-vs-angular-authentication.html),
implemented using Ember CLI.

Each step of the tutorial corresponds to a single commit in this repository.

## Caution

As we amend the tutorial, we might force-push to this repository to keep the
code in sync (while keeping each step in a single commit). Therefore, do not
link to any of the commits directly as the SHAs might change in the future. If
you must, consider linking to the corresponding [tags](https://github.com/BrewhouseTeam/ember-auth-example/tags)
instead. They will be updated and kept in-sync with the blog post in case of any
changes.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)

## Installation

* `npm install -g ember-cli`
* `git clone https://github.com/BrewhouseTeam/ember-auth-example`
* `cd` into the project
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

* `cd` into the project
* `ember server`
* Visit the app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

You will need [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to run the tests from the
command line. Once that's in place, you can run `ember test` to run the entire
test suite.

Alternatively, if you have the server running, you can also visit [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests)
to run the tests from your browser.
